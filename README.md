## Application for identifying and caring for plants

The user will be able to take a picture and identify the plant.
To access a page describing the plant, its name, its needs or where it comes from.
To browse, search and filter results from a database.
To mark some plants as favourites to access their data more easily.

## MoSCoW prioritized requirements
* M   
  * Plant description    
  * Picture recognition

* S   
  * Search by leaf shape/color, by bush/tree/grass shape, by flower size etc
  * User's favourites

* C   
  * See plants from the same family
  * Say if it's edible

* W   
  * A calendar to mark when to plant seeds during the year
  * Include recipes for the plant

## Implementation

Unfortunately, the API providing a plant database with pictures, Trefle.io, was archived on May 3rd.
I couldn't find an other open-access API offering the same features.
